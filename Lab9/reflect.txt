After completing this workshop, I backup an encrypted text file of characters to a binary file, restore the encrypted data from the binary file and add multi-threading to the solution. I have learned how to process partitioned data on two or more threads, also how to write a set of characters to a file in binary mode and read a set of characters from a file in binary mode. Also, I have learned how to use bind function to bind to its arguments.
